This is my journey understanding and creating a Git like project for my portfolio. 
I will be creating and adding small scripts which contribute to the working of Git as a whole while slowly building it my way up as a whole product.

Already added scripts:
1. Converting file to SHA1 value.
2. Multi Hash Generator with zlib compression with git-object like file creation and git-like folder structure
